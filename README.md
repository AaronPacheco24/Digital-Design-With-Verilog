## IMPORTANT

This repository's code is currently undergoing refactoring. Many parts of it are being rewritten to adhere to better practices, including parametrization and improving name-port connections. This work aims to enhance the code quality and more accurately represent my skills and development practices.


Code was initially done with Verilog on With Vivado 2019.1. Revisions are being made with SystemVerilog on Vivado 2022.2

Projects are designed with the intent of being programmed on a Digilent Nexys A7-50t FPGA
If there is no .xdc file, then the project is meant to be tested via simulation.
